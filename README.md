### Description

Well, after alot of hard work, I've got a new version of EShell. There are still a few bugs lurking in it that need to but ironed out but its pretty stable (DesktopAddon module doesnt like loading first time though). This time i've gone for a modularised Shell were each part is in a different EXE. ** IMPORTANT ** : READ THE RELEASE NOTES THAT ARE DISPLAYED WHEN YOU FIRST RUN ESHELL, COMPILE ALL THE EXE'S AS DESCRIBED OR ESHELL _WILL_NOT_ WORK!!!. Still to come: Replace the Explorer style file browser with an EShell module. A logoff button =o/. System monitor module. Module + Core crash detecting Module (what if that one crashes =oP). And some other stuff. Please vote, and leave comments. Thanks, Nick Ridley
